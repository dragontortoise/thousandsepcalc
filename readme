"thousandsepcalc" is a command line calculator which supports specifying
number with thousand separator.

I have a hard time using "bc" or "python interactive shell" as it does
not understand thousand separator.

You can run it like this.

  ./thousandsepcalc.py

Examples:

  1,200.65+2+(13-12,000)
  -10,784.35
